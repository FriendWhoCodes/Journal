## Pricing Psychology Deep Dive

### 1. Anchoring Effect

**Strategy:** Show individual prices first, then bundle.

```
Individual views: $9 + $9 + $9 + $12 + $15 = $54
Complete Pack: $29

"Save $25 (46% off) with Complete Pack!"
```

**Why it works:** 
- $54 becomes the anchor
- $29 feels like a steal
- Brain calculates savings, feels smart

---

### 2. Decoy Effect

**The Decoy:** Starter Pack at $19

```
Starter Pack: $19 (Week + Month only)
Complete Pack: $29 (ALL 5 views)
```

**Why it works:**
- User thinks: "For just $10 more, I get 3 extra views?"
- Starter Pack exists to make Complete Pack look better
- Some will buy Starter (still revenue), most upgrade to Complete

---

### 3. Price-Value Perception

| Price Point | Perception | Conversion |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| $9 | Impulse buy, low risk | High volume |
| $12 | Still affordable, slightly premium | Good volume |
| $15 | Premium, must be special | Lower volume, higher value |
| $19 | "Hmm, almost $20..." | Decoy effect |
| $29 | Sweet spot, "good deal" | Highest conversion |
| $49 | Serious investment, best value | Power users |

---

### 4. Charm Pricing

**Use $X.99 or round numbers strategically:**

- $9 (not $9.99) - Clean, simple, impulse-friendly
- $29 (not $29.99) - Professional, not cheap
- $49 (not $50) - Under psychological $50 barrier

**Alternative approach:**
- $9 → $7 (more impulse)
- $29 → $27 (under $30 barrier)
- Test both and measure

---

### 5. Loss Aversion

**Messaging after partial purchase:**

"You have Week View. You're missing:
- Month View (see monthly themes)
- Year View (365-day patterns)
- Decade View (long-term perspective)
- Life View (the big picture)

Complete your collection for just $20 more."

**Why it works:**
- They already invested
- Incomplete collection feels wrong
- "Just $20 more" vs "$45 for remaining" frames value

---

### 6. Social Proof Pricing

**Show what others buy:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⭐ MOST POPULAR                     │
│ Complete Pack - $29                 │
│ "73% of customers choose this"      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Reduces decision paralysis
- "If most people buy this, it must be right"
- Creates FOMO for non-bundle buyers

---

### 7. Urgency & Scarcity (Use Sparingly)

**Launch pricing:**
```
🚀 LAUNCH SPECIAL
Complete Pack: $29 $19
First 100 customers only
[87 remaining]
```

**Annual sale:**
```
🎄 END OF YEAR SALE
All Time Views 30% off
Ends December 31st
```

**Why it works:**
- Creates urgency to act now
- Limited quantity = scarcity
- But don't overuse (loses credibility)

---

## Revenue Projections

### Scenario: 1,000 Total Customers (Year 1)

**Distribution assumption:**
- 40% buy Complete Pack ($29) = 400 × $29 = $11,600
- 25% buy individual views (avg $12) = 250 × $12 = $3,000
- 15% buy Starter Pack ($19) = 150 × $19 = $2,850
- 10% buy Life View only ($15) = 100 × $15 = $1,500

**Plus conversions to Journal:**
- 20% of Time Views buyers try Journal = 200 users
- 50% convert to paid = 100 subscribers

- 10% buy Lifetime Pack = 500 × $49 = $24,500

**Total: $120,500** (from one viral moment)

## Objection Handling

### "I can do this in a spreadsheet"
"You could. But will you? Time Views makes it beautiful, automatic, and shareable. Plus, we've designed the reflection prompts so you actually gain insight, not just log data."

### "$29 is expensive for a tracker"
"Think of it as a $29 investment in understanding your life. That's less than a nice dinner. And unlike dinner, this lasts forever."

### "I only need Week View"
"Totally fair! Get just Week View for $9. If you love it, you can always add more later."

### "What if I don't use it?"
"We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If Time Views doesn't help you gain perspective on your life, we'll refund you completely."
